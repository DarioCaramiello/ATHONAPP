#----- ATHONAPP -----

##INTRODUCTION

Every quiz in AthonApp starts with a Start button.\
On clicking the Start button, there will be generated randomly the quiz questions.\
Every quiz category shows different challenges.\
Every question answered correctly assigns a point to the user which will be \
incremented to the Score linked to the user account on the Database. \
Once the user answers wrongly to the questions, will be provided, at the end of the Quiz,
a summary containing the answers and references to some external resources to check the error
and recover the eventual gap.\
Once a quiz has been done, it wonâ€™t be allowed to do it again during the same day.\
The user has 60 seconds to choose an answer, otherwise it will declared as an error. \
The user can choose to do every available quiz to keep increasing his score.
